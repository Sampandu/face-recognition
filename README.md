# Face Recognition App

## Overview

This app (<https://sampandu.github.io/face-recognition/>)allows user to input an url of an image, then detects whether an image contains human faces by making use of a third party API (Clarifai API).

Once a user signs in, our app will tell the user how many images are detected for the user so far.
